# Monero PHP Integration Library

**Currently in early development stage**   
that means I personally test some functions before this will be an useful package

## Short Instructions:
1. run ```composer install``` to install the symfony console dependencies
2. run a monero wallet rpc daemon 
3. You can now modify the TestCommand.php file to your credentials and test the rpc functions 

## Todo
- add exceptions
- add tests
- add all "important" monero wallet rpc functions
- pack eveything for a composer package
- add cryptonote methods (without shitty rpc)
- replace bcmath as it is slow
